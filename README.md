# Dataset
FungiTastic is a machine learning dataset for classification of fungi from images and metadata.

> **Disclaimer:** We are currently working on consolidating the code in different branches.

### Branch overview:

- **datasets_and_baselines**
  - Contains PyTorch datasets for all tasks
  - Includes many visualization functions
  - Provides a download script
  - Contains baselines for few-shot classification

- **picekl/training-scripts**
  - Scripts for standard open/closed set classification
  - Contains experiments with metadata
  - Includes code to prepare the metadata

- **zero_shot_seg**
  - Segmentation baseline based on GroundingDINO + SAM

- **feat/custom_metrics**
  - Contains evaluation metrics
